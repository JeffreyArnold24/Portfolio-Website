# Jeffrey Arnold's Portfolio
A robust full-stack application featuring a Next.js client and two servers: a Spring Boot API and a Flask API. Normally, I would stick to one type of server but for the purpose of demonstrating multiple skills I decided to use multiple. In addition to the client and servers I also have a folder for an sqlite database and for certain scripts that can help with managing the databases.

Please look into each folder for specifics of that aspect of the project.

# Note
This is not a completed project. While I do intend to work on and add to it over time, due to being busy with work, it is still not finished.
